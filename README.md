# Bettery
An app which helps the user to optimize charging his devices

To run the app you need Xcode installed. Open the project directly from GitHub (there is a button: “Open with Xcode” or download the source code and then open the .xcodeproj file. The next you need to do is go under your Projects Settings → Signing & Capabilities and then change the team to your own AppleID. If you haven’t paired your AppleID with Xcode yet, you can do that under Preferences → Accounts. After all these steps you can run the simulator and enjoy the app. (Since this is my first ever created app, there are many bugs, which I still need to fix. It can be helpful if you watch my video first, to see how to use the app.)
